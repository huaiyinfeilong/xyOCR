# Xinyi OCR

This is an NVDA addon that provides offline and online OCR recognition. Offline recognition is developed based on the PaddleOCR_json component.

This add-on currently provides PaddleOCR_json's offline OCR recognition engine and the online Baidu general version and accurate version of the recognition engine. After installing the add-on, the PaddleOCR_json component will be automatically installed. More other offline and online OCR recognition engines will be gradually connected in the future.

In addition, this plugin also provides image description function, which can identify image content.

## Addon Advantages

* The recognition speed is fast, and the offline recognition is about 100ms. The actual situation varies with the performance configuration of the computer.
* Powerful offline recognition accuracy, comparable to online recognition.
* The coordinates of the recognition result text are accurate, and the click response of the result text is accurate.
